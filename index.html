        <H2>The early days.</H2>
      <p>
      I was exposed to my first command lines in the late 1980s. I had the
      chance to learn on an early Army <i>command and control system</i> that was UNIX
      based. Horribly difficult to work with, the user-manual was <b>6 inches thick and
      8pt print</b>. Thankfully that soon gave way to Linux and later better GUI
      controls.

    <h2>Point and Click!</h2>
    
    <p>
      The <mark>PC revolution of the early 90s</mark>, with its mouse and point/click, soon
      put an end to my command line journey. I started more robust combat
      operations in those days and soon moved away from computers all together
      except as an end user. <p>The mouse really <sub>SUNK</sub> my command line usage.</p>

    <h3>Modern Times.</h3>
        <p>
      In 2004 I accepted an unpaid gig as an Administrator of a very large
      forum. This forum was based on a software called Vbulletin. .php, CSS, and
      some MySQL allowed me to get a taste of the coding environment. I wasnt
      coding in the sense of CREATING anything I was just asked to help tweak a
      nav bar here, or a profile field there.</p>
        <br />
      <p>Well, that did it, since 2004 Ive administrated, moderated, or simply
      owned my own forums. Vbulletin and now Xenforo are my preferable
      platforms. <p>My favorite forum software is <del>vbulletin</del> <ins>Xenforo</ins>!</p> 
      All of those projects failed mainly because it was impossible
      to compete with Reddit, Facebook and Twitter.</p> <p>Those huge platforms were well beyond my <sup>REACH</sup> to copy.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Here I am now. I want to learn more about front end and mobile development
      and add to my meager back-end skills. I have an empty forum now at
      <a href="https://www.talkandstuff.com/forum">Talk and Stuff!</a> I will
      add a responsive home page and develope a mobile app for that forum, some
      day.</p>
